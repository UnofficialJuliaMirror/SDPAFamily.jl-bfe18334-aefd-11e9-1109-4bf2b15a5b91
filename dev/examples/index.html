In quantum mechanical systems with finitely many degrees of freedom, states are represented by <em>density matrices</em>, which are <span>$d\times d$</span> matrices with complex entries that are positive semi-definite and have trace equal to one. States can be <em>measured</em>; mathematically, a measurement with <span>$n$</span> possible outcomes is represented by a set of measurement operators <span>$\{E_j\}_{j=1}^n$</span>, where each <span>$E_j$</span> is a <span>$d\times d$</span> matrix. For example, imagine an experiment in which a charged particle is released in a magnetic field such that it will hit either a detector on the left or a detector on the right. This corresponds to a measurement of the particle with two outcomes, and hence two measurement operators <span>$\{E_1, E_2\}$</span>, which to the left and right detector.</p><p>In order for <span>$\{E_j\}_{j=1}^n$</span> to be a valid set of measurement operators, each <span>$E_j$</span> must be positive semi-definite, and the family <span>$\{E_j\}_{j=1}^n$</span> must have the property that <span>$\sum_{j=1}^n E_j = I_d$</span>, the <span>$d\times d$</span> identity matrix. If the state of the system is represented by <span>$\rho$</span>, and a measurement with measurement operators <span>$\{E_j\}_{j=1}^n$</span> is performed, then outcome <span>$j$</span> is obtained with probability <span>$\operatorname{tr}[\rho E_j]$</span>.</p><p>Consider the case where <span>$d=2$</span> (i.e. the states are <em>qubits</em>), and the state of the system is either represented by <span>$\rho_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$</span> or by <span>$\rho_2 = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}$</span>, but we don&#39;t know which; let&#39;s say there is a referee who flipped a fair coin, and then prepared the system in either <span>$\rho_1$</span> or <span>$\rho_2$</span>. We will perform a measurement of the system, and then use the outcome to make a guess about the state of the system.  What is the measurement that gives the highest probability of correctly determining which state the system is in, and what&#39;s the optimal probability?</p><p>We will perform a measurement with measurement operators <span>$E_1$</span> and <span>$E_2$</span>. If we get outcome <span>$1$</span>, we will guess the system is in state <span>$\rho_1$</span> and and if we obtain outcome 2, we guess the system is in state <span>$\rho_2$</span>. Then the probability of guessing correctly is</p><div>\[p_\text{guess}(E_1, E_2) = \frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho_1  E_1) + \frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho_2  E_2)\]</div><p>since there is a 50% chance of the system being in state <span>$\rho_1$</span>, in which case we guess correctly when we get outcome 1 (which occurs with probability <span>$\operatorname{tr}(\rho_1 E_1)$</span>), and a 50% chance of the system being in state <span>$\rho_2$</span>, in which case we guess correctly when we get outcome <span>$2$</span>.</p><p>Our goal now is to choose the optimal measurement operators to have the the best chance of guessing correctly. That is, we aim to maximize the above expression over all choices of <span>$E_1$</span> and <span>$E_2$</span> such that <span>$\{E_1, E_2\}$</span> is a valid set of measurement operators. This is a semidefinite program, which can be solved e.g. with SDPAFamily.jl In this simple example, the problem can be solved analytically; in fact, this problem is Example 3.2.1 of the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/120_qcrypto/LN_Week3.pdf">edX Quantum Cryptography notes by Thomas Vidick</a>, from which it can be seen that the correct answer is</p><div>\[p_\text{guess} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}}\]</div><p>Let us see to what accuracy we can recover that result using the SDPA solvers.</p><pre><code class="language-julia">using SDPAFamily, Printf
